## Balls screensaver project

As part of studies working with Java Objects and StdDraw, I attempted a project to replicate the classic floating balls screensaver.  
  
Includes a executable ballAnimator.java program, usage described below, as well as a Ball object class used in the animator program. StdDraw is used for the graphics output.

### Usage

Compile with `javac ballAnimator.java`  
Run with `java ballAnimator N` where N is the number of balls to create.
