Implementation of late Conway's Game of Life.

### Compilation

Compile with `javac GameOfLife.java`

### Running

Run with `java GameOfLife`  
The program will prompt you for a grid size n, and create an nxn grid of cells.  
It then allows you to select cells to start off alive in generation 0, or allows you to randomise the initial state.  
On selecting 'Start' the game of life will begin, with toggles to allow you to speed up the number of generations per second, and exit the program at any time.
